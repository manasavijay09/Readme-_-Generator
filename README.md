README GENERATOR APPLICATION

A README file is an essential guide that gives other developers a detailed description of your GitHub project.

Contents of Readme File:

Include Your Project’s Title: This is the name of the project. It describes the whole project in few words and helps people understand the primary goal and aim.

Write a Description: Your description is an essential part of your project. A well-maintained description allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers.

How to Use Your Project: Provide instructions and examples so that users or contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them so that if they encounter a problem, they will always have a place of reference

A good README helps your project to stand out from other projects and should be as good as your project itself.

It’s the first thing to notice while encountering your project, so it should be pretty brief but detailed.

The quality of a README description differentiates a good project from bad ones.
